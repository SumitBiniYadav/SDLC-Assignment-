# SDLC Assignment - Software Engineering Study Work

Welcome to the **SDLC Assignment** repository! This project is a study work focused on exploring the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) concepts as part of a Software Engineering course. It includes a detailed document outlining key aspects of SDLC, designed to provide a clear understanding of the processes involved in software development.

## üìñ Project Overview

This repository contains an assignment document that dives into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software. The assignment is crafted to demonstrate a foundational understanding of SDLC methodologies, their phases, and their significance in software engineering.

The core content of this project is the **Assignment SDLC (Software Engineering).pdf**, which covers:
- Key phases of the SDLC (Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance)
- Insights into various SDLC models (e.g., Waterfall, Agile, Spiral)
- Practical applications and importance of SDLC in real-world software projects

This project serves as a learning resource for students and enthusiasts interested in software engineering principles.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Understand SDLC**: Grasp the fundamental concepts and phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- **Explore Methodologies**: Analyze different SDLC models and their use cases.
- **Apply Knowledge**: Demonstrate the application of SDLC principles through a structured assignment.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

- **Assignment SDLC (Software Engineering).pdf**: The main document containing the detailed assignment on SDLC concepts and methodologies.
